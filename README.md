# SMC-Deblender

SMC-Deblender is a probabilistic astronomical cataloging method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). It uses a novel block resampling scheme to detect and deblend light sources in highly ambiguous images of crowded starfields.

This repository contains the source code for "Sequential Monte Carlo for Detecting and Deblending Objects in Astronomical Images," a manuscript accepted to the [Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/) at NeurIPS 2023.
